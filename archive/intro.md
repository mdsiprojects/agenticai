The concept of AI agents has evolved over several decades, with significant milestones marking its development:​


## 1950s–1960s: Foundations
Alan Turing's introduction of the Turing Test in 1950 and the 1956 Dartmouth Conference laid the groundwork for artificial intelligence. In 1966, Joseph Weizenbaum's ELIZA program demonstrated rudimentary natural language processing, simulating conversation through pattern matching. ​


## 1970s–1980s: Rule-Based Systems
This era saw the rise of expert systems, which used predefined rules to emulate human decision-making in specific domains. Programming languages like PROLOG, introduced in 1972, facilitated logic-based AI development. ​

## 1990s: Emergence of Intelligent Agents
The term "intelligent agents" gained prominence, referring to systems that perceive their environment and take actions to maximize success. This period marked a shift towards modular AI systems capable of autonomous decision-making. ​

## 2020s: Rise of Agentic AI and Multi-Agent Systems
Advancements in large language models (LLMs) and machine learning have led to the development of agentic AI—autonomous systems capable of performing complex tasks without human intervention. Multi-agent systems, where multiple AI agents collaborate to solve problems, have also gained traction. The term "agentic AI" has become more prevalent in recent years, reflecting this shift towards greater autonomy in AI systems. ​

In summary, the industry's focus on AI agents began in the 1990s with the intelligent agent paradigm and has evolved into the current emphasis on agentic AI and multi-agent systems, particularly with the advancements in LLMs and autonomous decision-making capabilities in the 2020s.
