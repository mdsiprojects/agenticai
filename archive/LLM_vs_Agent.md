## **LLM vs Agent: Why Agents?**

|              | **LLM**                              | **AI Agent**                                        |
|--------------|---------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|
| 🧠 Mental Model | Predicts next word / response        | Goal-directed reasoning + planning                  |
| 🎯 Autonomy     | No autonomy (reacts to prompts)     | Can act independently with a goal                   |
| 🧰 Tool Use     | Needs explicit function calling      | Uses tools strategically, often with memory         |
| 🔄 Memory       | Stateless (unless engineered in)     | Remembers, reflects, adapts                         |
| ⛓️ Workflow     | Single-step / looped interaction     | Multi-step, iterative task execution                |
| 👥 Role          | Copilot, assistant                  | Worker, delegate, executor                          |

#### **Bottom: Framing Statement**

> “LLMs are powerful engines of language and knowledge...
> But Agents are how we give them *purpose, memory, and autonomy*.”
