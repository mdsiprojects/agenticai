- Chain-of-thought prompting enables large language models to perform complex reasoning by generating intermediate reasoning steps.
- In experiments, this approach significantly improved performance on various reasoning tasks, with a 540B-parameter model achieving state-of-the-art accuracy on the GSM8K math benchmark using only eight exemplars,surpassing even finetuned GPT-3 with a verifier.
