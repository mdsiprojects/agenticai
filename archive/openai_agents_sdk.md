# OpenAI Agents SDK



OpenAI's open-source [Agents SDK](https://openai.com/index/new-tools-for-building-agents/) provides developers with a framework to orchestrate single-agent and multi-agent workflows. It includes features like configurable large language models, intelligent task handoffs between agents, input and output validation guardrails, and tracing tools for debugging and performance optimization. This SDK aims to simplify the design and implementation of complex agentic workflows, making it accessible for various real-world applications such as customer support, research, and operational tasks.



This SDK started its life as the _swarm_ agent SDK. before it was renamed to Agents SDK on March 11 2025, hence, you are more likely to find references to swarm agent SDK on the web.

This article includes a good summary of the OpenAI Agents SDK: https://gabrielchua.me/posts/openai-agents-sdk-first-thoughts/.

Some of the key takeaways from the article are:
* Agents as Tools vs Handoffs
* Traceability improvements and the TracesUI
* Highliting some reliability issues in the use of guardrails and handoffs stickiness

There are some downsides of Swarm SDK*, the predecessor to the Agent SDK, which are still relevant to the current SDK:

  - **Stateless Architecture**: While it offers transparency, it complicates scenarios requiring persistent information across interactions, leading to inefficiencies in complex workflows or long-running tasks.

  - **Experimental Nature**: Being primarily for educational purposes, Swarm lacks the robustness and optimizations of production-ready systems, which may result in unexpected limitations, bugs, or performance issues.

  - **Manual Handoffs**: Dynamic agent transitions require careful design and testing to avoid deadlocks or miscommunications, which can disrupt conversation flow and lead to suboptimal performance.

  -**Sustainability Challenges**: The stateless design increases computational overhead as agents must constantly retrieve or rebuild context, making scalability and resource efficiency harder to achieve.

  - **Integration Difficulties**: Integrating Swarm with large, existing codebases or other frameworks can be challenging due to its limited ecosystem and compatibility.

  - **Limited Novelty**: Competing frameworks offer more mature orchestration mechanisms and broader compatibility, making Swarm less appealing for advanced multi-agent systems.
