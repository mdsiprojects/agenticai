# *LLMs – What Are They Good For?*


## 💡 *Core Capabilities of LLMs*

Natural Language Understanding & Generation: Comprehend and generate human-like text based on input prompts.

Knowledge Retrieval: Surface facts, definitions, or best-effort explanations based on pretraining (and optionally RAG).

Reasoning (to a degree): Perform step-by-step reasoning, answer questions, and generate structured outputs using techniques like chain-of-thought prompting.

Summarization & Rewriting: Condense long texts, paraphrase, or adapt tone/style.

Translation & Language Adaptation: Translate between languages or adjust writing style/format for different audiences.

## 🛠️ *Function Calling*

Extend LLMs beyond language by letting them invoke tools, APIs, or functions to fetch real-time data, perform calculations, or take actions.

Transforms LLMs into interactive orchestrators, not just static responders.

## 📌 *Use Cases in the Wild*

Chatbots & customer support assistants

Content generation (marketing, reports, docs)

Semantic search & summarization

Code generation & explanation (e.g. GitHub Copilot)

LLMs as copilots within enterprise apps (e.g. Microsoft 365 Copilot)

> 🧠 *But Remember:*
>
> LLMs operate in a single-turn or looped prompt/response paradigm. They don’t have persistent memory, goals, or autonomy by themselves.
> They react, they don’t act independently—and that’s where Agents come in.
