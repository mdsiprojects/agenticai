# Key Principles and Use of Tools

Learn how to code tools and use prompt libraries, this will be essential in defining agents with skills 

1. Use LLM ChatCompletion API, this excercise can be done with OpenAI SDK or Azure.AI.Inference SDK (we will use the azire.ai.inference sdk)
2. Leverage decelartive prompt configuration using prompty library: vs code extension, basic prompt configuraiton, test a prompt in vs code 
3. Learn Tools: using the azure.ai.inference SDK, configure a Chat Completion Client with tools, basic example to learn the orchestration of tools
4. Use prompty to configure tools declaritevly
5. Putting it all together: create an Agent with tools and skills

example: researcher agent: https://github.com/Azure-Samples/contoso-creative-writer/blob/main/src/api/agents/researcher/researcher.py
